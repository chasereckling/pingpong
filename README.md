------------------------------------

What is it?
-----------

PingPong Test is a program that user is prompted to enter a number, and then the page displays every number up to that number. But, for multiples of three, the page prints "ping" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, the page prints "pong". For numbers that are multiples of three and five, the page prints "ping-pong".
