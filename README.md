------------------------------------

What is it?
-----------

PingPong is a program that lets the user is prompted to enter a number, and then the page displays every number up to that number. But, for multiples of three, the page prints "ping" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, the page prints "pong". For numbers that are multiples of three and five, the page prints "pingpong".

Setup:
------

PingPong uses ruby version 2.2.0. After you download PingPong navigate to the 'ping_pong' file folder in your terminal:

1. open irb:

   $ irb

2. copy all the code in pingpong.rb, from the lib file. Paste into the terminal and hit enter.

3. enter in any number with the '.pingpong' method called on it:

   $ 15.pinpong()
    => [1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong", "ping", 7, 8, "ping", "pong", 11, "ping", 13, 14, "pingpong"]
